# Left Rotation
# A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. 
# For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2]. 
# Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.
# Given an array a of n integers and a number,d , perform d left rotations on the array. 
# Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

# Hash Tables: Ransom Note
# Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will be traced back to him through his handwriting. 
# He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. 
# The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. 
# He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.
# Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, 
# print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.
# Example
# magazine = "attack at dawn"; note = "Attack at dawn"

# Time Delta
# When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status update etc., 
# other users in their network are able to view this new post on their news feed. 
# Users can also see exactly when the post was published, i.e, how many hours, minutes or seconds ago.
# Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this can be confusing. 
# You are given two timestamps of one such post that a user can see on his newsfeed in the following format:
# Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx
# Here +xxxx represents the time zone. Your task is to print the absolute difference (in seconds) between them.

# Sherlock and the Valid String
# Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times. It is also valid if he can remove just  1 character at 1 index in the string, and the remaining characters will occur the same number of times. Given a string s, determine if it is valid. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.
# Example
# s = abc | This is a valid string because frequencies are {a:1,b:1,c:1}

# Compare the Triplets 
# Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
# The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).
# The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].
# If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
# Comparison points is the total points a person earned. Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

# Complete the function compareTriplets in the editor below.

# Return
# int[2]: Alice's score is in the first position, and Bob's score is in the second.
